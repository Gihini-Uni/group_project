A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage
dependencies for your project separately from your global Python installation. This is especially
useful when working on multiple projects with different dependency requirements. By using a
virtual environment, you can avoid conflicts between packages and ensure that your project
runs consistently across different systems.
3.⁠ ⁠Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:
	⁠.venv\Scripts\activate
4.⁠ ⁠Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask:
	⁠pip install Flask
